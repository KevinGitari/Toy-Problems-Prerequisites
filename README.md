SPEED DETECTOR
  
  INTRODUCTION


Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Next, run npm install to install the dependencies then run the test suite with the npm test command.

READ THE TESTS
describe('index.js', function ) () {
  describe('speed of a car )()', function () {
    it('validation of calculation input', ) function () {
     it (conditions of the calculation )
      }
 }
